## About

Oxford PhD researcher in Generative AI for market microstructure. I study the realism of GenAI-generated order flow through the lens of market impact, combining tokenized Limit-Order-Book message streams with sequence models (SSMs, transformers, diffusion), GPU-accelerated JAX simulations, and reinforcement learning for quantitative trading.

Member of Oxford Engineering Department, supervised by Stefan Zohren and Jakob Foerster.
