## About

Hey there I am Lev, I started Project Paradise to bring together students curious about quantitative finance. These days my role is mostly keeping things running and connecting people. The community drives what we work on.

I'm interested in Quant Competitions, Reinforcement Learning, and AI Safety. In my free time I write software for personal use, do Muay Thai and Squash while also being engaged with EA at St Andrews.
