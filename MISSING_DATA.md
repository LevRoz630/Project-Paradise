## 📝 Notes

- **Notion Export:** The zip files provided contained only the promising competitions table (already processed)
- **LOB Documentation:** Referenced in problem-statement.md but not in the zip
- **Member Links:** Currently in TODO.md to add links from competition write-ups to member profiles
- **YAML Data:** Has BOM characters and placeholder data, better to use static content for now
