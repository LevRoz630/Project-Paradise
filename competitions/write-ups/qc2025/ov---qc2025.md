## Part 1: Market Prediction

### Dataset

| Set | Variables | Time Range |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Training | 14 hidden vars (A-N, Y1, Y2) | 1-80000 |
| Test | Same vars excluding Y1/Y2 | 80005-96000 |
| Late Addition | O-P columns (~80% N/A) | 1 day before deadline |

### Objective

Achieve highest **R-squared score** in out-of-sample forecasts.

**Evaluation:** Weighted average of Y1 and Y2 R-squared scores

**Details:** [Algorithm]({{ '/competitions/write-ups/qc2025/ov---qc2025/algorithm/' | relative_url }}) | [Infrastructure]({{ '/competitions/write-ups/qc2025/ov---qc2025/infrastructure/' | relative_url }})

## Part 2: Basketball Trading

### Materials Provided

1. Variable documentation explaining factors influencing home team win probability
2. JSON file with example game event sequences
3. Base code for trading strategy

### Objective

Achieve highest **P&L** based on trading strategy.

### Trading Mechanics

| Action | Home Wins | Home Loses |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Buy at 50 | +50 profit | -50 loss |
| Short at 50 | -50 loss | +50 profit |

Contracts pay 100 if home team wins.

### Strategy: Possession-Based Model

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Outcomes | 4 per possession: [0, 1, 2, 3] points |
| Scoring | Score per second using team averages |
| Weights | Public basketball statistics |
| Adjustments | Individual player game fitness |

**Concepts Explored:** Bayesian updating, reinforcement learning, time-remaining probability

**Details:** [Algorithm]({{ '/competitions/write-ups/qc2025/ov---qc2025/algorithm/' | relative_url }})
