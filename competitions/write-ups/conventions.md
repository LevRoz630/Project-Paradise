# Write-Up Conventions

## Write-Up Conventions

Why do we need write-ups and what’s their aim?

- Accessible overview of methods and research from past comps on which we can built in future work
- Overview of the direction of the research and justification of the decisions that can be discussed with supervisors and other team members
- Outline of the course of any action, its reasoning and consequences from the point of view of the developer before anything is put into code

### OV - **Overview**

- **Aim:** Setting out of the goal, tools and restrictions of the competition so that anybody could get the framework for the research without going through 3 pages of competition rules.
- **Example:** [HKU-OV](https://www.notion.so/HKU-OV-25038a8638f8803e83f6f92b3561b73d?pvs=21)

### EX - Execution

- **Aim:** Overview of the thought process during the whole competition
- **Structure:**
    - **References**:
        - **Infrastructure**: Description of scripts used for comparison, backtest, any other tools that are key for the development and testing of an idea
        - **Ideas**: Depending on a competition can be models, data treatment, agent behavior hypothesis, feature engineering etc. All divided into sections to make the idea exchange and examination as easy as possible.
    - **Implementation**:
        - **Given a hypothesis** e.g. we think the data has well-defined regimes or we think this or that player in the market exhibits patterns in their behavior, etc
        - **Outline and describe** the ways to test it beyond reasonable doubt and implications of it being proven or disproved with the course of action after.
        - **Why?** This prevents us from having proven a hypothesis that is not implementable in our tasks or doesn’t make any sense. While it is common sense, with the abundance of information and possibilities too many time have I seen people spending hours on something that is useless.
