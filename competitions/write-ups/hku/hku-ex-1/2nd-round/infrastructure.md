## Overview

Given limited API documentation (basic docs and endpoint descriptions only), we built complete infrastructure for:

- Data parsing and processing
- Backtesting
- Validation

See [Infrastructure Changes]({{ '/competitions/write-ups/hku/hku-ex-1/2nd-round/infrastructure/infrachanges/' | relative_url }}) for updates from Round 1.
