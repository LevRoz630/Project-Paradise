<p class="page-intro">Things people in the community are curious about. Not commitments, just seeds. Some will become projects, some won't.</p>

## How This Works

Anyone can add an idea here. It doesn't need to be polished or feasible. If others are curious about the same thing, it might turn into a project.

**To add an idea:** mention it when you [introduce yourself]({{ '/join/' | relative_url }}), bring it up with any [member]({{ '/team/' | relative_url }}), or open a discussion on our [GitHub](https://github.com/LevRoz630/Project-Paradise/discussions){:target="_blank"}.
