  Fully separate page.                                                          
                                                                                
  Structured, curated content (guides, tools, examples), no need to surface     
  details on the hub.  Concrete fixes:                                          
                                                                                
  Use cards/tiles for sections (Development Standards / Before Starting /       
  Coding / Research) with a short 1-line description + 3–6 links each.          
                                                                                
  Tighten vertical spacing: reduce the huge gaps between headings; keep         
  consistent padding (e.g., 24–40px) and add subtle section separators.         
                                                                                
  Make link styling consistent: same font size/weight, add hover underline,     
  and avoid lone “→” as the only affordance; optionally add small icons.        
                                                                                
  Fix alignment/grid: use a 2–3 column grid for link lists so “GitHub Flow      
  / GitHub Projects” doesn’t float in empty space.                              
                                                                                
  Add a top “Quick links” row (most used 6–8 items) so the page feels           
  purposeful.                                                                   
                                                                                
  Typography: the H1/H2 are fine, but drop the oversized “Before Starting A     
  Project” or balance it with body content immediately under it (otherwise      
  it feels like a shout).

     resources hint visible

     arrows                                                                     
     4. Check projects page: Platform has "Library Development", Research       
     Publications has "Python" + "Research"
