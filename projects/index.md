## Start Something New

Have an idea for a project? Here's how it works:

1. **Pitch it.** Share your idea with the community, even if it's rough.
2. **Find people.** Others who are interested will join.
3. **Start building.** Meet up, figure out the approach, and learn as you go.

It doesn't need to be polished or original. If you're curious about something, chances are someone else is too. Reach out on the [Join page]({{ '/join/' | relative_url }}) or talk to any [community member]({{ '/team/' | relative_url }}).
