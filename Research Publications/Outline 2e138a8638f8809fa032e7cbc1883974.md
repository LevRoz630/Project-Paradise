# Outline

### What this is

A way for small student teams to ship real research writeups that are **public**, **reproducible**, and **easy to review.**

### What do you get as a researcher

- **Skill + portfolio compounding:** you learn to go from idea → experiment → writeup → publish, and build a track record that’s immediately usable for recruiters/grad programs.
- **Platform leverage:** you get access to the platform to run experiments, generate clean artifact bundles (tables/plots/logs), and ship a “golden run + golden test” that makes your work verifiable and easy to share.
- **High-quality feedback + network:** industry supervisors sanity-check correctness, suggest methods and related work, and you get attributed feedback.

### What do you get as a supervisor

- **Influence without heavy commitment:** a review that actually changes a shipped output, without ongoing mentoring.
- **Intellectual stimulation:** exposure to new approaches, clean writeups, and a steady stream of “interesting problems” to comment on.
- **Optional credit:** they *can* be acknowledged publicly, but it’s strictly opt-in / anonymisable by default.

### What counts as a “publication”

A short research note (usually **2–5 pages**, longer if it genuinely adds value) with:

- a clear question + takeaway
- existing methods
- used method + results
- limitations / what might break
- a reproducible run + artifacts

### Teams (how we work)

- Each paper is done by a **team of 1–4 students**.
- Teams pick topics and approaches freely, the only hard rules are the reproducibility and publishability bar.
- **One active paper per team** at a time, so things actually finish.

### Everything is public

- Default is **publish openly**.
- If something uses restricted/proprietary inputs, it still needs to be publishable without leaking anything — otherwise we don’t run that project.

### Supervisor reviews (industry)

- Supervisors review for **correctness**, suggest **better methods**, and point to **relevant prior work**.
- Credited publicly unless they ask to be anonymous.

### How a paper moves (simple stages, doesn’t need to be in this order)

- **Draft:** question + plan + what “success” looks like
- **Consultation:** supervisor feedback
- **Run:** produce artifacts + golden run
- **Write:** claims + plots + limitations + a short summary
- **Review:** supervisor feedback
- **Publish**

### What success looks like

- papers get shipped regularly
- anyone can reproduce results from the links
- supervisors can review quickly without meetings
- platform steadily gets better because real papers keep pushing it
