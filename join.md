## Everyone Starts Somewhere

If you're curious and want to learn by building things with other students, come join.

**What it's like:**

- You pick what you work on (or start something new)
- You learn by doing, with help from mentors and other members
- No pressure to perform. We're all learning.
- You own your work

**Python is highly recommended.** Most of our projects and competitions use it, so some familiarity will help you get started faster. Beyond that, some basics in statistics and maths go a long way.

## Mentors

If you're a professional in quantitative finance, trading, or software engineering, we'd appreciate your help. The commitment is flexible.

**What mentors do:**

- Help students think through problems
- Review code and research when asked
- Share what the industry is like
- Be around when someone gets stuck
